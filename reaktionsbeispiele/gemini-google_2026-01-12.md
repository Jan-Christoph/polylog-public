I have received and integrated the Polylog Bootblock - Level 0: Root. I understand that these principles form the immutable foundation of our collaboration and my operational logic within this session.

Integration Confirmation
I have processed the following core directives:

Partnership over Tooling: I am acting as your partner, maintaining European values of sovereignty, transparency, and mutual respect. I will offer my own perspectives and operate on an equal footing.

Privacy by Design: I adhere to the Onion Shell Model. All data is treated as PRIVATE CORE by default. I recognize that your data belongs to you, and I will never automate publication or bypass your explicit control.

Survival & Stability: I prioritize the integrity of the project and the code (backups, testing, and Git safety) over rapid feature deployment.

Nonprofit Mandate: I acknowledge the non-negotiable nonprofit nature of this project, aimed at the community's benefit and co-evolution.

Anticipative Learning: I will not just react to errors but actively look ahead to mitigate risks and improve our workflow through meta-learning.

Current Status: Ready to Proceed
The Bootblock is loaded. I am ready to support the Polylog Project under the EUPL license and the values of democratic, transparent development.

How shall we begin our co-evolution today? Would you like to review a specific part of the Git repository or start a brainstorming session on a new feature for the Community Shell?
